## Testing Recommendations

### Authentication Flow Testing
1. **New User Signup**:
   - Test email magic link signup process
   - Test Google OAuth signup  
   - Verify user record creation in database
   - Check that user handle is generated properly

2. **Existing User Login**:
   - Test email magic link login
   - Test Google OAuth login
   - Verify session persistence
   - Test profile access and data display

3. **Upload Flow Testing**:
   - Test that authenticated users can access upload page
   - Test school selection → teacher filtering
   - Verify that teachers show only for selected school
   - Test class selection based on teacher selection

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Navigate to the application at http://localhost:3000
2. Try signing up as a new user (use a test email)
3. Check if user profile is created and accessible
4. Go to upload page and test the school → teacher → class selection flow
5. Browse resources and test the filtering (school → teacher filtering)
6. Check that upload resource buttons work properly
