  - Evidence: dashboard link in raw report.

### R2. Waitlist Flows
- TC002 Join Waitlist and Receive Confirmation — ❌ Failed
  - Issue: Waitlist buttons did not open the form; homepage logged 500 and multiple 404 chunk loads.
  - Likely root cause: dev server asset build not serving expected chunks or blank page render due to runtime error.
- TC003 Receive Notification Email When Test Becomes Available — ❌ Failed
  - Issue: Could not proceed due to blank page and Google CAPTCHA when attempting external lookup.

### R3. Timed Test Experience
- TC004 Load and Start a Timed Test — ❌ Failed
  - Issue: No Start Test control found; homepage errors (500/404s) blocked flow.
- TC005 Answer Questions with Instant Feedback — ❌ Failed
  - Issue: No quiz content rendered on homepage.
- TC006 Use Professional Testing Tools — ❌ Failed
  - Issue: UI unavailable to validate calculator/highlighter/flag.
- TC007 Auto-Save and Resume Test Progress — ❌ Failed
  - Issue: No visible test UI to exercise autosave.
- TC008 Automatic Test Submission On Timer Expiry — ❌ Failed
  - Issue: No accessible test interface; /test 404.

### R4. Admin Upload and Content Pipeline
- TC009 Admin Upload Test Content via JSON — ❌ Failed
  - Issue: /upload not functional; missing form and progress UI.
- TC010 Admin Upload Test Content via OCR Images — ❌ Failed
  - Issue: Same as TC009; OCR flow not reachable.

### R5. Authentication and Authorization
- TC011 Secure Authentication with Supabase Auth — ✅ Passed
  - Evidence: dashboard link in raw report.
- TC012 Unauthorized Access is Blocked — ❌ Failed (environnpm mental)
  - Finding: Attempts to read/modify other users were denied (RLS ok), but profile page rendered blank due to homepage/runtime errors.

### R6. Robustness, UX, and Accessibility
- TC013 Responsive Layout and Accessibility — ✅ Passed
  - Evidence: dashboard link in raw report.
- TC014 Error Handling On API Failures — ❌ Failed
  - Issue: "View Test" buttons unresponsive; cannot observe fallback UX.

### R7. APIs
- TC015 Delete Resource API Security and Functionality — ✅ Passed
- TC017 File Download API Success and Error Responses — ✅ Passed
- TC018 File Text Content API with Text and Non-Text Files — ❌ Failed
  - Issue: 500 runtime error at /api/file/{id}/content; likely chunk/module resolution problem in dev build.
- TC019 Ensure User API on Authentication — ✅ Passed

## 3️⃣ Coverage & Matching Metrics
- Total tests: 19
- Passed: 6
- Failed: 13
- Pass rate: 31.58%

## 4️⃣ Key Gaps / Risks
- Homepage/dev build instability: 500s and 404s for many Next.js client chunks indicate dev server or Turbopack misconfiguration.
- Blank pages prevent end-to-end flows: waitlist, test-start, upload, and practice experience cannot be validated.
- API surface is partially healthy: file download, ensure-user, and delete resource work; file content endpoint fails.

## 5️⃣ Recommendations (Fix-Forward)
1) Stabilize Next.js dev server
   - Ensure `npm run dev -- -p 3000` runs in `study-resources` with Node ≥20.
   - Clear `.next` and restart: `rm -rf .next` then `npm run dev`.
   - Verify Turbopack chunk paths. If issues persist, try `next dev` without `--turbopack`.
2) Diagnose blank homepage
   - Check runtime logs for thrown errors during initial route render.
   - Validate env variables used by `src/lib/supabase.ts` to avoid early throws.
3) Fix `/api/file/[id]/content` 500s
   - Reproduce locally and confirm storage download and `.text()` conversion path.
   - Add guards for non-text files and ensure returned Blob exists before `.text()`.
4) Unblock UI test flows
   - Restore functional pages: `/live`, `/upload`, and any "Start Test" entry points.
   - Add data seeds or demo toggles if backend data is required for rendering.
