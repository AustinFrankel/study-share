## ✅ Verified Column Names

I checked your **actual database schema** and verified:

- ✅ `comments.author_id` (not commenter_id)
- ✅ `resource_ratings.user_id` (not rater_id)
- ✅ `flags.flagger_id` (correct)
- ✅ `flags` table has NO status column
- ✅ All other columns verified

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

After clicking "RUN", you should see:

```
✅ Created resource_ratings indexes
✅ Created monthly_view_limits indexes
✅ Created flags indexes
✅ Created resource_tags indexes
```

Then scroll down to see a table of all 17+ indexes created.
