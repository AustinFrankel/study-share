### 1. ‚úÖ Enhanced OCR with Google Gemini AI

**What Was Fixed:**
- Replaced basic OCR.space API with Google's powerful Gemini 1.5 Flash AI
- Implemented intelligent question parsing and structuring
- Tests now automatically upload and become visible to everyone immediately

**New Files Created:**
- `/src/lib/gemini-ocr.ts` - Google Gemini AI integration with full OCR processing

**How It Works:**
1. Admin uploads test images at `/live/upload?test={testId}&name={testName}`
2. Enters password: **"Unlock"**
3. Selects images and clicks "Process & Upload Test"
4. Google Gemini AI:
   - Extracts text from each image with high accuracy
   - Intelligently parses questions, choices, answers, and explanations
   - Structures data into proper JSON format
5. Saves to `test_resources` table with `upsert` (overwriting any existing data)
6. **Test is now immediately visible to all users**
7. Redirects to test page automatically

**API Keys Used:**
- Google Gemini API: `AIzaSyD4icVauYHyo7e0Tdtd5TqBjDrQHWKRgM4`
