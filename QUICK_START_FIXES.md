# Quick Start - Do This Now! 🚀

## 1️⃣ Run SQL (2 minutes)
```
1. Open: study-resources/RUN_THIS_SQL.sql
2. Go to Supabase → SQL Editor
3. Copy entire file contents
4. Paste and click RUN
5. Look for ✅ checkmarks
```

## 2️⃣ Test File Upload (30 seconds)
```
1. Go to your homepage
2. Open console (F12)
3. Drag ANY file onto the page
4. Drop it
5. Should navigate to /upload WITH the file
```

## 3️⃣ What I Fixed

### ✅ Navigation Hover
- "Study Share" text scales up (no purple)
- Changed in: `Navigation.tsx`

### ✅ Unique Usernames
- Database constraint added
- 3 code locations check for duplicates
- Fixed in: SQL migration + `auth.ts` + `ensure-user/route.ts`

### ✅ Leaderboard
- Fixed query logic
- Created materialized view
- Fixed in: `gamification.ts` + SQL migration

### ✅ Admin Uploads
- Past tests visible to everyone
- Fixed RLS policies
- Fixed in: SQL migration

### ✅ File Upload Bug (MAJOR FIX!)
- **THE BIG ONE**: Files lost during drag-drop
- Completely rewrote state management
- Used global singleton pattern
- Fixed in: `UploadContext.tsx` + `GlobalDropzone.tsx`

## 🔥 The File Upload Fix Explained

**Before:** Files stored in React state → lost during navigation
**After:** Files stored in global singleton → survives navigation

**How it works:**
```
Drop file → GlobalStorage saves it → Navigate → 
New page mounts → GlobalStorage still has it → Success! 🎉
```

## 📊 Expected Console Output

When you drag-drop a file:
```
GlobalDropzone: Files dropped: 1
GlobalDropzone: Valid files after filtering: 1  
GlobalDropzone: Setting pending files and navigating
GlobalStorage: Setting 1 files
UploadProvider: Received update from global storage: 1 files
GlobalDropzone: Navigating to /upload
UploadProvider: Subscribing to global storage
UploadProvider: Syncing with global storage on mount: 1 files
UploadWizard: pendingFiles effect: 1 files
```

If you see all these logs → **IT WORKS!** ✅

## ⚠️ If File Upload Still Fails

Share these with me:
1. Console logs (full output)
2. What page you dropped from
3. What happens (does it navigate? do files appear?)

I'll debug further! I won't stop until it's 100% working. 💪

## 📁 All Changes

1. `study-resources/RUN_THIS_SQL.sql` - **RUN THIS FIRST**
2. `src/contexts/UploadContext.tsx` - Global state storage
3. `src/components/GlobalDropzone.tsx` - Removed delay
4. `src/components/Navigation.tsx` - Hover scale effect
5. `src/lib/auth.ts` - Unique handle checks
6. `src/app/api/ensure-user/route.ts` - Unique handle checks
7. `src/lib/gamification.ts` - Leaderboard query fix
