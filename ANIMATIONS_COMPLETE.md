# âœ… COMPLETE - Micro-Animations Implementation

## What You Asked For

> "When I go from browse to live to profile to notifications, micro animations that are smooth transitions from screen to screen. Also make the header elements more like an optimized site - when I hover around them there is not hit radius or box that comes up but rather a visual change in the text that is subtle."

## What Was Delivered

### âœ… Smooth Page Transitions
- **Browse â†’ Live â†’ Profile â†’ Notifications**: Smooth 200ms fade + slide animations
- Uses Framer Motion for high-performance transitions
- No jarring instant page changes

### âœ… Optimized Header Hover Effects
- **No background boxes** on hover (removed all `hover:bg-*` from navigation)
- **Subtle text color changes** to indigo-600
- **No hit radius/box appearance** - clean, minimal design
- All transitions: 200ms smooth

### âœ… Enhanced Micro-Animations
- Logo scales + color change
- Upload button scales on hover
- Avatar scales on hover
- Notification badge pulses
- Dropdown items slide smoothly
- All GPU-accelerated for 60fps
