## ðŸ”§ OAuth & Magic Link Configuration Needed

### Issue 1: Google OAuth `redirect_uri_mismatch`

**Problem**: Google OAuth shows "Access blocked: Study Share's request is invalid" error.

**Root Cause**: The Google Cloud Console OAuth client doesn't have the correct Supabase callback URL configured.

**Fix Required**:

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**:
   - Navigate to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Select your project
   - Go to **APIs & Services** â†’ **Credentials**
   - Click on your OAuth 2.0 Client ID

2. **Add Authorized Redirect URI**:
   ```
   https://dnknanwmaekhtmpbpjpo.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   ```

3. **Save Changes**

### Issue 2: Magic Link Uses localhost Instead of studyshare.app

**Problem**: Magic link emails contain `localhost:3000` URLs instead of production domain.

**Root Cause**: The environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is set to `http://localhost:3000` in `.env.local`.

**Fix Required**:

1. **Update Vercel Environment Variables**:
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
   - Update or add:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://studyshare.app
     ```
   - Make sure to set this for **Production** environment
   - Click **Save**

2. **Update Supabase Configuration**:
   - Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
   - Select your project: `dnknanwmaekhtmpbpjpo`
   - Navigate to **Authentication** â†’ **URL Configuration**
   - Set **Site URL** to:
     ```
     https://studyshare.app
     ```
   - Under **Redirect URLs**, add:
     ```
     https://studyshare.app/auth/callback
     ```
   - Click **Save**

3. **Redeploy on Vercel**:
   - After updating environment variables, trigger a new deployment
   - The new deployment will pick up the updated `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`

### Testing After Fixes

**Test Google OAuth**:
1. Go to `https://studyshare.app`
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Should redirect successfully without errors

**Test Magic Link**:
1. Click "Sign in with Email"
2. Enter your email
3. Check your email for the magic link
4. Click the link - should redirect to `https://studyshare.app`, NOT `localhost:3000`

## ðŸ“‹ Feature Request: Include Live Tests in Search/Browse

### Current State
- Live tests (SAT, ACT, AP Exams, etc.) are only visible on `/live` page
- Search and Browse pages only show uploaded study resources

### Requested Enhancement
Include live test countdowns and links in:
1. Search results page (`/search`)
2. Browse page (`/browse`)
3. Recent sections on homepage (`/`)

### Implementation Approach

This would require:

1. **Create a unified search/browse result type** that can include both:
   - Study resources (from `resources` table)
   - Live tests (from test dates constants)

2. **Update search logic** to:
   - Search through test names (SAT, ACT, AP exams)
   - Return test results alongside resource results
   - Prioritize upcoming tests in results

3. **Create a TestCard component** for search/browse:
   - Similar to ResourceCard but displays test countdown
   - Links to `/live/test?test={testId}` for past tests
   - Shows "Join Waitlist" for upcoming tests

4. **Modify these files**:
   - `src/app/search/page.tsx` - Add test search logic
   - `src/app/browse/page.tsx` - Include tests in browse
   - `src/app/page.tsx` - Show recent tests on homepage
   - Create `src/components/TestSearchCard.tsx` - Compact test display

### Example Implementation Snippet

```typescript
// In search/page.tsx or browse/page.tsx
import { STANDARDIZED_TESTS_2025, AP_EXAMS_2025 } from '@/lib/test-dates'

// Combine tests with resources
const allTests = [...STANDARDIZED_TESTS_2025, ...AP_EXAMS_2025]
const matchingTests = allTests.filter(test =>
  test.name.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase()) ||
  test.fullName.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
)

// Display both resources and tests
return (
  <>
    {matchingTests.length > 0 && (
      <section>
        <h2>Live Tests</h2>
        {matchingTests.map(test => (
          <TestSearchCard key={test.id} test={test} />
        ))}
      </section>
    )}

    <section>
      <h2>Study Resources</h2>
      {resources.map(resource => (
        <ResourceCard key={resource.id} resource={resource} />
      ))}
    </section>
  </>
)
```

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Clarify requirements:
   - Should tests appear mixed with resources or in a separate section?
   - Should all tests be shown or only relevant ones (e.g., upcoming)?
   - What should the priority/sorting be?

2. Create the TestSearchCard component

3. Update search and browse pages

4. Add tests to homepage recent section

**Note**: This feature was not implemented in this round of fixes. Would you like me to proceed with implementing this feature?

## Summary

All requested UI/mobile fixes have been completed âœ…. The OAuth configuration requires manual updates in Google Cloud Console, Vercel, and Supabase (documented above). The live tests integration is a larger feature request that requires additional implementation work.
