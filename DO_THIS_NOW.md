# 🚀 QUICK START - Do These 3 Things NOW

## ⚡ Step 1: Run This SQL (2 minutes)

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor:**  
   https://app.supabase.com/project/dnknanwmaekhthmpbpjpo/sql

2. **Open this file in your project:**  
   `SUPABASE_SETUP_COMPLETE.md`

3. **Copy the entire SQL block** (starts at line ~15)

4. **Paste into SQL Editor** and click **RUN**

5. **Verify you see:**
   - ✅ Tables created
   - ✅ Policies created
   - ✅ Row counts displayed

---

## ⚡ Step 2: Restart Your Dev Server (30 seconds)

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then run:
npm run dev
```

---

## ⚡ Step 3: Test Everything (3 minutes)

### Test Upload:
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/live/upload?test=sat-test&name=SAT%20Test
2. Password: `Unlock`
3. Upload any image
4. Should process without "404 model not found" error
5. Should redirect to test page

### Test Visibility:
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/live
2. Uploaded test should appear
3. Open **incognito mode** → test still visible ✅

### Test Archive Formatting:
1. Scroll to "Past Tests Archive" section
2. Should have dark gradient header
3. Should have nice filters
4. Should look professional

### Test Buttons:
1. Click "View" on past test → navigates to test page ✅
2. Click "Join Waitlist" on upcoming test → opens dialog ✅
3. Submit waitlist → shows success ✅

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

Everything is working when:

- [ ] SQL ran without errors
- [ ] Dev server restarted
- [ ] Upload test → no Gemini API error
- [ ] Test visible on /live immediately
- [ ] Test visible in incognito mode
- [ ] Archive section looks professional
- [ ] View button works
- [ ] Join Waitlist button works

---

## 🆘 If Something's Wrong

### Upload fails with Gemini API error:
- Should be fixed (using v1beta endpoint now)
- Check console for specific error

### Test not visible after upload:
- Did you run the SQL? Check Supabase SQL Editor history
- Verify policies: `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'test_resources'`
- Should show 3 policies (read, insert, update)

### Archive section looks wrong:
- Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+F5` (Windows)
- Clear browser cache
- Check in incognito mode
