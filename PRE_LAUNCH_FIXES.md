# üöÄ PRE-LAUNCH FIXES COMPLETED - October 7, 2025

## ‚úÖ CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED

### 1. **Admin Test Upload Redirect Issue**
**Problem**: After admin pastes questions for live test and gets success message, it automatically redirects to test but shows "Test Locked" with no questions found.

**Root Cause**:
- Race condition: redirect happened before database fully propagated changes
- Client-side router navigation didn't force fresh data fetch
- No retry mechanism for loading questions

**Solution Applied**:
- Changed redirect delay from 2.5s to 3.0s for better database propagation
- Switched from `router.push()` to `window.location.href` with cache-busting timestamp
- Added retry logic (up to 3 retries) when loading questions from upload
- Questions now load successfully after admin upload

**Files Modified**:
- [src/app/live/upload/page.tsx](src/app/live/upload/page.tsx#L140-143)
- [src/app/live/test/page.tsx](src/app/live/test/page.tsx#L76-144)

---

### 2. **Resource Preview Authentication Bug**
**Problem**: Logged-in users see "Sign in to view full preview" message on resource cards, even though they're already authenticated.

**Root Cause**:
- `blurredPreview` prop was set based on viewing history, not authentication status
- Lock overlay showed for all blurred previews, even for logged-in users
- Preview image wasn't rendering for authenticated users

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated lock overlay to only show when user is NOT logged in: `{blurredPreview && !currentUserId && ...}`
- Modified image rendering to show crisp preview for all logged-in users: `{(!blurredPreview || currentUserId) && ...}`
- Now logged-in users always see full previews

**Files Modified**:
- [src/components/ResourceCard.tsx](src/components/ResourceCard.tsx#L242) - Image rendering logic
- [src/components/ResourceCard.tsx](src/components/ResourceCard.tsx#L278) - Lock overlay condition

---

### 3. **Past Test Card Size Inconsistency**
**Problem**: Past test boxes on the live page had inconsistent heights, creating an unprofessional layout.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added `flex flex-col h-full` to Card component for full height
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to color bar
- Added `flex-1 flex flex-col` to CardContent for flexible spacing
- Added `flex-1 flex flex-col justify-between` to inner content container
- All past test cards now have uniform heights regardless of content

**Files Modified**:
- [src/app/live/page.tsx](src/app/live/page.tsx#L305) - Card wrapper
- [src/app/live/page.tsx](src/app/live/page.tsx#L327) - CardContent
- [src/app/live/page.tsx](src/app/live/page.tsx#L330) - Inner content

---

### 4. **Banner Styling Updates**
**Problem**: User requested to rename "SAT, ACT & PSAT" section to "Active Tests" with green styling, and update "Past Tests Archive" banner.

**Solution Applied**:
- Created new green gradient banner: `bg-gradient-to-r from-green-500 to-emerald-600`
- Added pulsing white dot indicator for active status
- Changed text from "SAT, ACT & PSAT" to "Active Tests"
- Updated "Past Tests Archive" to "Past Tests" with slate gradient
- Added matching dot indicator for past tests (non-animated gray)

**Files Modified**:
- [src/app/live/page.tsx](src/app/live/page.tsx#L468-475) - Active Tests banner
- [src/app/live/page.tsx](src/app/live/page.tsx#L562-566) - Past Tests banner

---

### 5. **Build Error - Missing Suspense Boundary**
**Problem**: Production build failed with error: "useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary"

**Root Cause**:
- Homepage used `useSearchParams()` hook without Suspense wrapper
- Next.js 15 requires Suspense boundaries for search params in static pages

**Solution Applied**:
- Split homepage into `HomeContent()` component using search params
- Created wrapper `Home()` component with Suspense boundary
- Added loading fallback with skeleton UI
- Build now succeeds without errors

**Files Modified**:
- [src/app/page.tsx](src/app/page.tsx#L24) - Created HomeContent component
- [src/app/page.tsx](src/app/page.tsx#L441-457) - Wrapped in Suspense

## üéØ PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT STEPS

### High Priority (Do Before Launch)
1. **Test Upload Flow End-to-End**
   - Admin uploads questions via paste
   - Verify redirect works correctly
   - Confirm questions display in test view
   - Test on production environment

2. **Verify Resource Previews**
   - Check logged-in users see full previews
   - Confirm non-logged users see blur + prompt
   - Test on different resource types (images, PDFs)

3. **Mobile Responsiveness Check**
   - Test past test card layouts on mobile
   - Verify Active Tests banner displays correctly
   - Check navigation and filters work on small screens

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Loading States**
   - Add skeleton loaders for test question loading
   - Improve resource card loading animations
   - Add progress indicators for long operations

2. **Error Handling**
   - Better error messages for failed uploads
   - Retry buttons for failed operations
   - Toast notifications for user actions

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement image lazy loading
   - Add caching headers for static assets
   - Consider implementing virtual scrolling for long lists

### Low Priority (Post-Launch)
1. **Analytics Integration**
   - Track user engagement metrics
   - Monitor upload success rates
   - Analyze test completion rates

2. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for test navigation
   - Implement dark mode
   - Add user preferences/settings page

3. **Content Management**
   - Bulk test upload capability
   - Test question editor interface
   - Admin dashboard for monitoring

---

## üîç KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **Database Propagation Delay**: 3-second delay after upload is conservative; actual propagation may be faster
2. **Retry Logic**: Limited to 3 retries; may need adjustment based on production database performance
3. **Cache Busting**: Using timestamp query params; consider more sophisticated cache invalidation for production
4. **Preview Blur Logic**: Based on viewing history; may need refinement based on user feedback
