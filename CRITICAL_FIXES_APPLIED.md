# CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED - October 7, 2025

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines all critical fixes applied to address:
1. **Unique Username Enforcement** - No two users can have the same handle
2. **Leaderboard Data Issues** - Fixed data fetching and display
3. **Admin Upload Visibility** - Ensured past test uploads are visible to all users
4. **UI Polish** - Fixed "Study Share" hover effect

---

## 1. ✅ Study Share Logo Hover Effect

### What Was Fixed
- Removed purple color change on hover for "Study Share" text
- Text now scales slightly (1.05x) on hover instead of changing color
- Maintains consistent branding

### Files Modified
- `src/components/Navigation.tsx`

### Changes Made
```tsx
// BEFORE: transition-colors duration-200 group-hover:text-indigo-600
// AFTER: transition-all duration-200 group-hover:scale-105
```

## 2. ✅ Unique Username/Handle Enforcement

### Problem
- Multiple users could have the same username/handle
- No database constraint prevented duplicates
- Race conditions could create duplicate handles

### Solution Implemented

#### Database Migration (`supabase/migrations/030_unique_handle_and_fixes.sql`)
1. **Fixed Existing Duplicates**: Automatically adds number suffixes to duplicate handles
2. **Added Unique Constraint**: `ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT users_handle_unique UNIQUE (handle)`
3. **Created Index**: `CREATE INDEX idx_users_handle ON users(handle)` for fast lookups

#### Code Changes
Updated three locations to check for handle uniqueness before creating:

**A. `/src/app/api/ensure-user/route.ts`**
```typescript
// Now checks if handle exists before creating user
let handle = generateRandomHandle()
let attempts = 0
const maxAttempts = 10

while (attempts < maxAttempts) {
  const { data: existing } = await dbClient
    .from('users')
    .select('id')
    .eq('handle', handle)
    .single()
  
  if (!existing) {
    break // Handle is unique
  }
  
  handle = generateRandomHandle()
  attempts++
}
```

**B. `/src/lib/auth.ts` - `createUserDirectly()` function**
- Same uniqueness check logic applied
- Retries up to 10 times to generate unique handle
- Returns null if can't generate unique handle after 10 attempts

**C. `/src/lib/auth.ts` - `regenerateHandle()` function**
- Same uniqueness check when user regenerates their handle
- Prevents regeneration from creating duplicate handles

### How to Apply
1. Run the migration: `supabase migrations up`
2. Or manually execute the SQL in Supabase SQL Editor
3. Deploy updated code to production

## 3. ✅ Leaderboard Fixes

### Problem
- Leaderboard wasn't displaying correctly
- `user_points` was causing query issues
- Join problems between `user_points` and `users` tables

### Solution Implemented

#### Database Changes (`030_unique_handle_and_fixes.sql`)
1. **Created Materialized View**: `user_points` is now a materialized view for better performance
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW user_points AS
SELECT 
  user_id,
  COALESCE(SUM(delta), 0) as total_points,
  COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
  MIN(created_at) as first_transaction,
  MAX(created_at) as last_transaction
FROM points_ledger
GROUP BY user_id;
```

2. **Added Indexes**:
   - `idx_user_points_user_id` - For user lookups
   - `idx_user_points_total_desc` - For leaderboard sorting

3. **Auto-refresh Function**: Created `refresh_user_points()` function
4. **Scheduled Refresh**: Attempts to schedule refresh every 5 minutes (if pg_cron available)

#### Code Changes (`src/lib/gamification.ts`)
- **Fixed Query Logic**: Removed problematic joins
- **Two-step Fetch**: Fetches points first, then user details separately
- **Better Error Handling**: Returns empty array instead of crashing on errors

```typescript
// Now queries user_points and users separately
const { data: pointsData } = await supabase
  .from('user_points')
  .select('user_id, total_points')
  .order('total_points', { ascending: false })
  .limit(limit)

// Fetch user details separately
const userIds = pointsData.map(entry => entry.user_id)
const { data: usersData } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('id, handle, avatar_url')
  .in('id', userIds)
```

### Maintenance Required
Run this SQL periodically to keep leaderboard fresh:
```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY user_points;
```

Or set up a cron job if you have access to pg_cron extension.

## 4. ✅ Admin Past Test Upload Visibility

### Problem
- When admins uploaded past tests, they weren't visible to all users
- RLS policies may have been blocking visibility
- `test_resources` table structure issues

### Solution Implemented

#### Database Changes (`030_unique_handle_and_fixes.sql`)
1. **Recreated `test_resources` Table**: Ensures correct structure
2. **Added Unique Constraint**: `test_resources_test_id_unique` prevents duplicate test IDs
3. **Fixed RLS Policies**:
   - `"Anyone can view test resources"` - SELECT for everyone (including anonymous)
   - `"Authenticated users can insert test resources"` - INSERT for authenticated users
   - `"Authenticated users can update test resources"` - UPDATE for authenticated users

4. **Auto-update Timestamp**: Created trigger to update `updated_at` on changes

#### How It Works
- Admin uploads test via `/live/upload` page
- Uses UPSERT to handle existing tests: 
  ```typescript
  .upsert({
    test_id: testId,
    test_name: testName,
    questions: ocrResult.questions,
    uploader_id: user?.id || null,
    created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
  }, {
    onConflict: 'test_id',
    ignoreDuplicates: false
  })
  ```
- **SELECT policy allows everyone to view** - No authentication needed
- Test appears on `/live/past` and `/live/test` pages for all users

### Verification
After applying migration, verify with:
```sql
-- Check if test_resources policies exist
SELECT * FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'test_resources';

-- Should show 3 policies:
-- 1. Anyone can view test resources
-- 2. Authenticated users can insert test resources  
-- 3. Authenticated users can update test resources
```

## 5. ✅ File Upload Improvements (Already Applied)

### What Was Done Previously
- Files now auto-advance to Step 2/4 when added
- Drag-and-drop properly retains files
- Preview detection improved to check both MIME type and file extension
- Blurred previews work correctly for gated content

---

## Testing Checklist

### Username Uniqueness
- [ ] Try creating a new user - should get unique handle
- [ ] Try regenerating handle - should get unique handle
- [ ] Check database: `SELECT handle, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY handle HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;` - Should return 0 rows

### Leaderboard
- [ ] Visit homepage or profile page
- [ ] Leaderboard should display users with points
- [ ] Ranking should be correct (highest points first)
- [ ] User avatars and handles should display
- [ ] Refresh materialized view: `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY user_points;`
- [ ] Check again to ensure data is current

### Admin Test Uploads
- [ ] Login as admin
- [ ] Navigate to `/live`
- [ ] Select a past test that has no content
- [ ] Upload test content (images or text)
- [ ] Verify upload success message
- [ ] **Logout or use incognito window**
- [ ] Navigate to `/live/past`
- [ ] Select the test you just uploaded
- [ ] Verify questions are visible to anonymous/non-admin users
- [ ] Try taking the test as a non-admin user

### UI Polish
- [ ] Hover over "Study Share" logo
- [ ] Text should scale slightly larger
- [ ] Text should NOT change color to purple
- [ ] Logo icon should still scale and get shadow on hover

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Apply Database Migration
```bash
# If using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or manually in Supabase SQL Editor
# Copy and paste contents of:
# supabase/migrations/030_unique_handle_and_fixes.sql
```

### 2. Deploy Code Changes
```bash
# Build and deploy your Next.js app
npm run build
# Deploy to your hosting platform (Vercel, etc.)
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
1. Check migration ran successfully in Supabase dashboard
2. Test username creation
3. Test leaderboard display
4. Test admin upload functionality

### 4. Set Up Maintenance
**Option A: If you have pg_cron extension**
```sql
-- Migration already created this, verify it exists:
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'refresh-user-points';
```

**Option B: Manual refresh (run periodically)**
```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY user_points;
```

**Option C: Set up external cron job**
Create a webhook/API endpoint that runs:
```typescript
await supabase.rpc('refresh_user_points')
```

Then use your server's cron or a service like GitHub Actions to call it every 5-10 minutes.

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

### Rollback Database Changes
```sql
-- Remove unique constraint
ALTER TABLE users DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS users_handle_unique;

-- Drop materialized view
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS user_points;

-- Recreate as simple view (old behavior)
CREATE VIEW user_points AS
SELECT user_id, SUM(delta) as total_points
FROM points_ledger
GROUP BY user_id;
```

### Rollback Code
```bash
# Revert to previous git commit
git revert HEAD
git push

# Redeploy
```

---

## Additional Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Materialized view refresh takes a few seconds on large datasets
- Concurrent refresh allows queries during refresh
- Consider running refresh during low-traffic periods

### Future Enhancements
1. Add ability to reserve usernames (premium feature)
2. Implement real-time leaderboard updates (WebSocket)
3. Add test upload history and versioning
4. Implement test review/approval workflow

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Handle Uniqueness Issues
**Problem**: User sees "Failed to generate unique username"
**Solution**: 
1. Check database for excessive duplicate patterns
2. Increase word lists in `generateRandomHandle()`
3. Consider adding more random digits (currently 0-999)

### Leaderboard Not Updating
**Problem**: Leaderboard shows stale data
**Solution**:
```sql
-- Manually refresh
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY user_points;

-- Check last refresh time
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
WHERE relname = 'user_points';
```

### Test Upload Not Visible
**Problem**: Uploaded test doesn't appear for other users
**Solution**:
1. Check RLS policies: `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'test_resources';`
2. Verify test was saved: `SELECT * FROM test_resources WHERE test_id = 'your-test-id';`
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure `questions` field is not empty
