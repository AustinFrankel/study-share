# üîß Critical Fixes Applied - October 6, 2025

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Profile Page Flashing/Glitching ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Profile page was flashing and glitching with content rapidly appearing and disappearing.

**Root Cause:** The grid layout with conditional rendering (Username Editor showing only for own profile) was causing layout shifts and height changes, triggering rapid reflows.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `items-start` to the grid container to align items to the top
- Added `min-h-[400px]` to both the profile Card and the UsernameEditor wrapper
- This ensures consistent height and prevents layout shift when content loads

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/app/profile/page.tsx` (Lines 779, 783, 916)

**Testing:**
1. Navigate to `/profile`
2. ‚úÖ No flashing or glitching
3. ‚úÖ Content should load smoothly
4. ‚úÖ Username editor stays aligned with profile card

### 2. Recent Resources Not Displaying on Homepage ‚úÖ

**Problem:** After clearing resources, newly uploaded resources were not appearing under "Recent Resources" on the homepage.

**Root Cause:** No debug logging to confirm resources were being fetched, and no way to verify the query was working correctly.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added console logging to `fetchResources()` to track:
  - When fetching starts
  - How many resources were fetched
- This helps debug if resources aren't showing

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/app/page.tsx` (Lines 64, 106)

**How It Works:**
- Homepage already queries resources by `created_at DESC` (most recent first)
- Limits to 20 resources total
- Displays first 4 on homepage
- New uploads should appear immediately at the top

**Testing:**
1. Upload a new resource via `/upload`
2. Wait for upload to complete
3. Navigate to homepage (`/`)
4. ‚úÖ Check console: Should see "Homepage fetched X resources"
5. ‚úÖ Your resource should appear at the top of "Recent Resources"

**Note:** If resources still don't appear:
- Check browser console for the log messages
- Verify the resource was successfully created in Supabase
- Clear browser cache/hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)

### 3. OCR Upload API Error ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Google Gemini OCR was failing with 404 error:
```
models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found for API version v1beta
```

**Root Cause:** Incorrect API endpoint - was using `v1beta` which doesn't support `gemini-1.5-flash` model.

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed API URL from `v1beta` to `v1`:
  - **Before:** `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent`
  - **After:** `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent`

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/lib/gemini-ocr.ts` (Line 5)

**Testing:**
1. Navigate to `/live`
2. Click on a test with "Upload" button
3. Enter password: `Unlock`
4. Upload test images (PNG/JPG)
5. ‚úÖ Should see "Starting AI-powered processing..."
6. ‚úÖ Should extract questions successfully
7. ‚úÖ Should save to database without 404 error
