# ⚡ QUICK FIX - DO THIS NOW

## ✅ What I Just Fixed

### 1. Added VERIFICATION Step After Upload
- Upload now **verifies data was saved**
- Queries database immediately after save
- Shows error if verification fails
- Won't redirect unless data is confirmed saved

### 2. Added EXTENSIVE Logging
- Every step logs to console with emojis
- Can see exactly where it fails
- Full data objects logged for debugging

### 3. Added "Retry / Refresh" Button
- On locked screen, click this to reload
- Forces fresh query from database
- Shows debug info with test ID and state

## 🎯 Most Likely Issue

**If verification fails or query fails:**
- **Cause:** SQL migration not run yet
- **Fix:** Run `RUN_THIS_SQL.sql` in Supabase
- **Verify:** Check console for specific error code

## 📝 Share These With Me If It Fails:

1. ALL console logs (copy/paste entire console)
2. Screenshot of "Test Locked" screen with debug info
3. The test ID you're trying to upload to

**The logs will tell me EXACTLY what's wrong!** 🔍

## 🚀 Files Changed:

1. `src/app/live/upload/page.tsx` - Added verification step
2. `src/app/live/test/page.tsx` - Added detailed logging + retry button
3. `UPLOAD_DEBUG_GUIDE.md` - Full debugging guide

**Everything is ready - test it now!** ✅
