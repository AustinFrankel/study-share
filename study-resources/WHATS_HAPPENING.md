# 🎯 FINAL ANSWER - What's Happening

## The Issue You're Seeing:

**Console shows:**
```
Error: PGRST116 - Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object
Details: The result contains 0 rows
```

**Translation:** 
The database query is working perfectly, but **there's no data for test_id = 'sat-jun'**.

The test has **NOT been uploaded yet**.

---

## What This Means:

✅ Database table exists (`test_resources`)  
✅ RLS policies are working (query executes)  
✅ SQL migration ran successfully  
❌ **No one has uploaded content for this test yet**

The system is working correctly - it's just showing you the "Test Locked" screen because there's no content uploaded.

---

## What You Need To Do:

### 1. Upload Test Content FIRST
Before you can view a test, you must upload it:

1. Click **"Upload Content (Admin)"** button on the locked screen
2. Enter password: `Unlock`
3. Select test images
4. Wait for processing
5. Upload will complete and verify
6. Then redirect to test page

### 2. What To Look For In Console During Upload:

**Success upload will show:**
```
Saving to test_resources: {test_id: "sat-jun", ...}
✅ Successfully saved to database
✅ Verified: 52 questions saved
Redirecting to test page...
```

**Then on test page:**
```
Loading questions for test: sat-jun
✅ Loaded 52 questions
```

---

## 🧪 Test It Now:

1. **Go back to the locked screen**
2. **Click "Upload Content (Admin)"**
3. **Upload the test images**
4. **Watch console** - you'll see the save and verify messages
5. **After redirect** - test should load with questions

---

## Why It Shows "Test Locked":

The system correctly detected:
- Test ID: `sat-jun`
- Database query: ✅ Working
- Result: 0 rows (no data uploaded yet)
- Action: Show "Test Locked" screen with upload button

**This is the CORRECT behavior when no content exists!**

---

## What I Fixed:

1. ✅ Removed verbose debug logging (cleaner console)
2. ✅ Removed retry button and debug UI
3. ✅ Added verification step after upload
4. ✅ Simplified error messages

---

## Summary:

**The system is working perfectly!**

The "Test Locked" screen is showing because you haven't uploaded content for `sat-jun` test yet.

**Next step:** Click "Upload Content (Admin)" and upload the test images. Then it will work! 🚀
