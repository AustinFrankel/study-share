# âœ… Fixes Applied - October 8, 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ Main Issues Fixed

### 1. **Resource Display Consistency** âœ“
**Problem:** Homepage (Recent Resources) showed "Preview unavailable" and "Unknown User" while Browse page showed proper previews and user handles.

**Root Cause:** Homepage was using a restrictive query that only fetched specific fields, while Browse page used `*` and `uploader:users(*)` to get all user data.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated homepage query in `src/app/page.tsx` to match Browse page structure
- Changed from specific field selection to `*` with proper relations
- Now fetches complete user data: `uploader:users(*)`
- Added file path fields for better preview support

**Files Changed:**
- `/Users/austinfrankel/Downloads/AnswersHelp/study-resources/src/app/page.tsx`

**Result:** Both pages now show identical resource cards with:
- Proper user avatars
- Correct usernames/handles
- Image previews when available
- All metadata (difficulty, study time, etc.)

---

### 2. **Resource Card Padding Fix** âœ“
**Problem:** Resource cards had extra vertical padding that prevented content from filling the card properly.

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed Card component padding from `py-6` to `py-0`
- Added `overflow-hidden` for better image containment
- Added `hover:shadow-md transition-shadow` for improved UX

**Files Changed:**
- `/Users/austinfrankel/Downloads/AnswersHelp/study-resources/src/components/ui/card.tsx`

**Result:** Resource cards now:
- Fill their containers properly
- Have smooth hover transitions
- Display content edge-to-edge as intended

---

### 3. **Test Card Gradient Intensity** âœ“
**Problem:** Bottom test cards (AP Exams, Regents) had very intense gradients that were "too much" - user requested more solid colors.

**Fix Applied:**
- Reduced gradient intensity across all AP Exams
- Changed from `x-500 to y-600` to `x-400 to x-500` (same color family)
- Applied same fix to all Regents tests
- Maintains color distinction while being more subtle

**Files Changed:**
- `/Users/austinfrankel/Downloads/AnswersHelp/study-resources/src/lib/test-dates.ts`

**Examples:**
- AP Biology: `from-green-500 to-emerald-600` â†’ `from-green-400 to-green-500`
- AP Chemistry: `from-teal-500 to-cyan-600` â†’ `from-teal-400 to-teal-500`
- Regents Chemistry: `from-purple-500 to-pink-600` â†’ `from-purple-400 to-purple-500`

**Result:** Test cards now have:
- Softer, more professional gradient appearance
- Consistent visual weight with SAT/ACT cards
- Better readability of text on colored backgrounds

---

### 4. **Active Tests Banner Styling** âœ“
**Problem:** Active Tests section (SAT, ACT, PSAT) didn't match the visual style of the Past Tests section below it.

**Fix Applied:**
- Wrapped Active Tests in white card with rounded corners
- Added green gradient header: `from-green-500 via-green-600 to-green-700`
- Added border: `border-2 border-green-200`
- Added content area gradient: `from-green-50 to-white`
- Matches Past Tests Archive styling but with green theme

**Files Changed:**
- `/Users/austinfrankel/Downloads/AnswersHelp/study-resources/src/app/live/page.tsx`

**Result:** Active Tests and Past Tests sections now:
- Have consistent card-based layouts
- Use similar header/content structure
- Feel like cohesive parts of the same interface
- Maintain distinct colors (green vs gray) for quick identification

---

### 5. **Profile Page Layout Improvements** âœ“
**Problem:** Profile page content was left-aligned, stat cards were too small, and lacked visual hierarchy.

**Fix Applied:**

**Background & Container:**
- Changed to softer gradient: `from-blue-50 via-white to-indigo-50`
- Reduced max-width: `max-w-6xl` â†’ `max-w-5xl` for better centering
- Grid layout: `lg:grid-cols-[1.5fr_1fr]` â†’ `lg:grid-cols-[2fr_1fr]`

**Header:**
- Center-aligned all header content
- Increased title size: `text-3xl` â†’ `text-4xl`
- Better spacing: `mb-2` â†’ `mb-3`, `py-10` maintained

**Tab Navigation:**
- Center-aligned tabs with `justify-center`
- Increased margin: `mb-6` â†’ `mb-8`

**Cards:**
- Added `shadow-md rounded-xl` to all major cards
- Added `hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow` to stat cards
- Increased spacing: `gap-6` â†’ `gap-8`

**Stats Cards:**
- Increased icons: `w-8 h-8` â†’ `w-10 h-10`
- Increased numbers: `text-2xl` â†’ `text-3xl`
- Increased gaps: `gap-4` â†’ `gap-6`
- Added padding: `pt-6` â†’ `pt-8`
- Added gradient backgrounds to Total Points and Global Rank cards
- Added `font-medium` to labels

**Avatar & Username:**
- Increased avatar: `w-12 h-12` â†’ `w-16 h-16` (own profile)
- Increased username: `text-xl` â†’ `text-2xl/text-3xl`
- Made username bold instead of semibold

**Files Changed:**
- `/Users/austinfrankel/Downloads/AnswersHelp/study-resources/src/app/profile/page.tsx`

**Result:** Profile page now has:
- Professional centered layout
- Better visual hierarchy
- More prominent stats and badges
- Consistent card styling throughout
- Improved readability and spacing

## ðŸ”§ Server Error Note

**The Supabase MCP server errors you're seeing are unrelated to these UI fixes.** The errors show:

```
TypeError: Invalid URL
at new URL (node:internal/url:825:25)
code: 'ERR_INVALID_URL',
input: '--connection-string'
```

This is a VS Code extension configuration issue with the Model Context Protocol server. It's trying to parse `--connection-string` as a URL when it's actually a command-line flag.

**To fix this (if needed):**
1. Check your `.vscode/settings.json` or VS Code Copilot settings
2. Ensure the Supabase connection string is properly formatted
3. This doesn't affect your actual application - only the VS Code extension

**Your application runs fine** - this is just a VS Code tooling issue that can be ignored or fixed separately.
