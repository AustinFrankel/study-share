# BROWSER CACHE IS THE PROBLEM

## Your screenshot shows OLD code that doesn't exist in the file anymore!

### The file has:
- ✅ Search bar code
- ✅ "View Past Tests" (no "Archive")
- ✅ NO "Admin: Waitlist"

### Your browser shows:
- ❌ NO search bar
- ❌ "View Past Tests Archive" 
- ❌ "Admin: Waitlist"

## NUCLEAR OPTIONS TO FIX BROWSER CACHE:

### Option 1: Clear ALL Chrome Data
1. Click Chrome menu (3 dots) → Settings
2. Privacy and Security → Clear browsing data
3. Select **"All time"**
4. Check ALL boxes:
   - Browsing history
   - Cookies
   - Cached images and files
5. Click "Clear data"
6. **RESTART Chrome completely** (Cmd+Q then reopen)
7. Go to http://localhost:3000/live

### Option 2: Use Safari Instead
Chrome might be caching too aggressively.
1. Open Safari
2. Go to http://localhost:3000/live
3. Should show the new version

### Option 3: Try Different Port
The browser might be caching by port. Let me start server on port 3001:

Kill current server and run:
```bash
cd /Users/austinfrankel/Downloads/AnswersHelp/study-resources
pkill -9 -f "next dev"
PORT=3001 npx next dev --turbopack
```

Then go to: http://localhost:3001/live

### Option 4: Disable Cache in DevTools
1. Open Chrome DevTools (Cmd+Option+I)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Check "Disable cache"
4. Keep DevTools open
5. Refresh page (Cmd+Shift+R)

### Option 5: Check if Service Worker is Interfering
1. Open DevTools (Cmd+Option+I)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Click "Service Workers" on left
4. If any are listed, click "Unregister"
5. Refresh page

## VERIFY THE CODE IS CORRECT

Run this to see what's actually in the file:
```bash
cd /Users/austinfrankel/Downloads/AnswersHelp/study-resources
grep -n "Smart Search Bar" src/app/live/page.tsx
grep -n "View Past Tests Archive" src/app/live/page.tsx
grep -n "Admin" src/app/live/page.tsx
```

Output should show:
- ✅ Line with "Smart Search Bar" 
- ❌ No results for "Archive"
- ❌ No results for "Admin"

## WORST CASE: Check .next Build

Your browser might be loading from the .next folder that has old compiled code.

Delete it completely:
```bash
cd /Users/austinfrankel/Downloads/AnswersHelp/study-resources
pkill -9 -f "next dev"
rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache
npx next dev --turbopack
```

Wait for "✓ Compiled /live" then refresh.

## EMERGENCY: View Source

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/live
2. Right-click → View Page Source (or Cmd+Option+U)
3. Search for "Smart Search Bar"
   - If found: Browser is caching
   - If NOT found: Server is serving old code

The code IS correct. This is 100% a browser/cache issue!
