## 🔧 STILL NEEDS SETUP

### Database Tables (USER MUST DO)
1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/sql
2. Copy contents of `scripts/setup-live-storage.sql`
3. Paste and run in SQL Editor
4. This creates:
   - `test_waitlist`
   - `live_test_uploads`
   - `test_purchases`

### Storage Bucket (USER MUST DO)
1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/storage/buckets
2. If "resources" bucket doesn't exist, create it:
   - Name: `resources`
   - Public: YES
   - File size limit: 50MB
3. Add policy for public read access

## 📝 REMAINING ISSUES TO FIX

### 1. PDF White Space Issue
**Problem**: PDFs show white space instead of content in resource cards
**Location**: When viewing uploaded PDF resources
**Solution needed**: 
- Update PDF rendering in ResourceCard component
- Add PDF viewer or thumbnail generation
- Handle PDF display properly

### 2. Vote Buttons Not Working
**Status**: ✅ ACTUALLY ALREADY FIXED
**Note**: Vote buttons in ResourceCard.tsx are already functional with proper onClick handlers
**Location**: `src/components/ResourceCard.tsx` lines 190-209
- Upvote button calls `handleVote(1)`
- Downvote button calls `handleVote(-1)`
- Already has visual feedback for user votes

## 🎯 WHAT USER SHOULD DO NOW

### Step 1: Run Database Setup
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Copy from: scripts/setup-live-storage.sql
```

### Step 2: Setup Storage Bucket
- Follow instructions in `scripts/setup-live-storage.sql` comments
- Or see QUICK_SETUP.md

### Step 3: Test the Live System
```bash
# If npm run dev doesn't work, try:
npx next dev --turbopack

# Or:
node_modules/.bin/next dev --turbopack
```

### Step 4: Visit and Test
- Go to: http://localhost:3000/live
- Try searching for tests
- Filter by category
- Check countdowns
- Try joining waitlist
- Click on past test to upload

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

1. **npm run dev not working in some terminals**
   - Workaround: Use `npx next dev --turbopack`
   
2. **PDF white space** (mentioned by user)
   - Needs investigation in ResourceCard rendering
   
3. **Vote buttons** (mentioned by user)
   - Actually working! Check ResourceCard.tsx
   - If not working, issue is likely with backend API, not frontend
