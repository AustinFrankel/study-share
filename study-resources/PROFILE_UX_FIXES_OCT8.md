# Profile Page & Authentication UX Improvements - October 8, 2025

## ‚úÖ All Issues Fixed

### 1. Sign-In Modal X Button Navigation ‚úÖ
**Problem:** The X button on the "Sign In Required" modal didn't work properly when clicking to close.

**Solution:**
- Modified the Dialog component's `onOpenChange` handler in `src/app/resource/[id]/page.tsx`
- Now when user clicks X button or tries to close modal, they are redirected to home page (`/`)
- This provides a graceful exit instead of being stuck on the resource page

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/resource/[id]/page.tsx` (Line 1248)

---

### 2. Phone Number Authentication Error Handling ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Twilio error "Invalid parameter (60200)" when trying to sign in with phone number.

**Root Cause:** Twilio SMS provider is not configured in Supabase, or the phone authentication feature needs to be enabled in Supabase settings.

**Solution:**
- Added better error handling in `src/components/PhoneAuth.tsx`
- Now displays user-friendly message: "Phone authentication is not currently configured. Please use email sign-in instead."
- Added debug logging to help diagnose phone format issues
- Phone number format is correct (E.164: +1XXXXXXXXXX)

**What You Need to Do:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Providers
2. Enable Phone provider
3. Configure Twilio credentials (Account SID, Auth Token, Phone Number)
4. Or disable the phone sign-in option if not using it

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/PhoneAuth.tsx` (Lines 58-72)

---

### 3. Profile Picture Upload UI Improvement ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Profile picture upload buttons were displayed separately below the avatar, looking unnatural.

**Solution:**
- Moved upload controls to small icon buttons positioned under the avatar
- Blue circular upload button with upload icon (+)
- Red circular remove button with X icon (only shows when avatar exists)
- Buttons appear at bottom-right of avatar with nice shadow
- Much cleaner, more modern look similar to popular social media apps

**Design:**
```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ         ‚îÇ
‚îÇ Avatar  ‚îÇ
‚îÇ         ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ[+][√ó]
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx` (Lines 980-1006)
- Removed old button section (Lines ~1008-1028)

---

### 4. Watch Ad & Upload Buttons Redesign ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Buttons had basic colors and didn't stand out enough.

**Solution:**
- **Watch Ad Button:** 
  - Beautiful gradient: `from-emerald-500 to-green-600`
  - Hover: `from-emerald-600 to-green-700`
  - Added Play icon (‚ñ∂)
  - Text: "Watch Ad (+1)" (shorter, clearer)
  - Enhanced shadow and transitions

- **Upload Button:**
  - Beautiful gradient: `from-blue-500 to-indigo-600`
  - Hover: `from-blue-600 to-indigo-700`
  - Added Upload icon (‚¨Ü)
  - Text: "Upload (+5)" (shorter, clearer)
  - Enhanced shadow and transitions

- Both buttons now have:
  - Gradient backgrounds
  - Font weight: semibold
  - Shadow effects (hover makes them "lift")
  - Smooth transitions
  - Icons for better visual recognition

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx` (Lines 1010-1023)
- Added Play icon import (Line 45)

---

### 5. Leaderboard Duplicate Title Fix ‚úÖ
**Problem:** "Leaderboard" title appeared twice - once in the outer Card header and once in the Leaderboard component itself.

**Solution:**
- Added `hideTitle` prop to Leaderboard component
- When `hideTitle={true}`, the internal title and header are hidden
- Adjusted padding so content is closer to top when title is hidden
- Profile page now shows only the outer card title
- All content is properly aligned and spaced

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/Leaderboard.tsx` (Lines 17-19, 88-107)
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx` (Line 1175)
