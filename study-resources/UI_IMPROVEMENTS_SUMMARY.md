# UI Improvements Summary - October 7, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Profile Page - Wider Profile Card ✅
**What Changed:**
- Modified the grid layout from `lg:grid-cols-3` (2:1 ratio) to `lg:grid-cols-[1.5fr_1fr]`
- Profile card on the left now takes up more space (1.5 units vs 1 unit for leaderboard)
- Better balance between profile information and leaderboard display
- More room for profile content and better visual alignment

**File Changed:**
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx` (line 794)

**Why:**
The profile card needed more horizontal space to properly display user information, stats, and controls without feeling cramped.

### 2. Live Page - Fixed View Button ✅
**What Changed:**
- Changed past test routing from `/live/view` to `/live/test`
- "View" button now properly navigates to the test interface
- Simplified routing logic (removed unnecessary test name encoding)
- Tests now load correctly when clicked

**File Changed:**
- `src/app/live/page.tsx` (line 207-220)

**Why:**
The View button was routing to the wrong page. Now it correctly opens the Bluebook-style test interface at `/live/test?test={id}`.

---

### 3. Live Page - Grouped Past Tests with "View More" ✅
**What Changed:**
- Archived tests now grouped by test name (SAT, ACT, PSAT, etc.)
- Shows only the most recent test by default
- "View More" button displays older test dates
- Consistent with the existing SAT/ACT/PSAT section pattern
- Mobile-responsive expand/collapse functionality

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/live/page.tsx` (lines 619-683)

**Implementation:**
```
For each test type (e.g., "SAT"):
1. Group all archived tests by name
2. Sort by date (newest first)
3. Display most recent test card
4. If multiple dates exist, show "View X Past [Test] Tests" button
5. Clicking expands to show all past dates
6. "Show less" button collapses back to most recent
```

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner interface - no visual clutter
- Easy to find most recent test
- Option to explore past dates when needed
- Filters still work (Month/Year/Subject) alongside grouping

---

## Visual Impact

### Profile Page
**Before:** Profile card was narrow (2 columns out of 3)
**After:** Profile card is wider (60% vs 40% split with leaderboard)

### Live Page - Archived Tests
**Before:** 
- All archived SAT tests shown at once (cluttered)
- Example: SAT Oct 2024, SAT Sep 2024, SAT Aug 2024... all visible

**After:**
- Only most recent SAT test shown
- "View 5 Past SAT Tests" button to expand
- Cleaner, more focused interface

## Notes
- The SAT/ACT/PSAT section already had this grouping logic - we just applied the same pattern to archived tests
- Each test group in archived section uses unique key: `archived-${testName}` to avoid state conflicts
- Expansion state stored in `expandedGroups` object (existing pattern)
