# Critical Fixes Applied - October 7, 2025 (Part 2)

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Infinite Loop in AuthContext
**Problem**: The authentication context was stuck in an infinite loop, repeatedly calling `refreshUser()` and triggering re-initialization.

**Root Cause**: 
- `refreshUser` was in the dependency array of the `useEffect`
- The `INITIAL_SESSION` event was triggering `refreshUser()` even though it was already handled in `initializeAuth()`
- This caused continuous re-initialization and repeated console logs

**Solution**:
- **File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Removed `refreshUser` from the `useEffect` dependency array (line 208)
- Added `hasInitialized` flag to prevent duplicate initialization
- Skip `INITIAL_SESSION` event in `onAuthStateChange` since it's already handled
- Only handle specific auth events: `SIGNED_IN`, `SIGNED_OUT`, `TOKEN_REFRESHED`
- Prevents the infinite loop of auth state changes

**Changes**:
```typescript
// Before: [refreshUser] in dependency array caused loops
useEffect(() => {
  // ... initialization
}, [refreshUser])

// After: Empty dependency array, runs once
useEffect(() => {
  let hasInitialized = false
  
  const initializeAuth = async () => {
    if (hasInitialized) {
      console.log('‚è≠Ô∏è Auth already initialized, skipping')
      return
    }
    hasInitialized = true
    // ... rest of init
  }
  
  // Skip INITIAL_SESSION event to prevent loops
  if (event === 'INITIAL_SESSION') {
    console.log('‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping INITIAL_SESSION event (already handled)')
    return
  }
}, [])
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Blank Space Issue for Past Tests (ACT/SAT)
**Problem**: When viewing past test dates (ACT, SAT, PSAT), there was excessive blank space to the right of each test card.

**Root Cause**: 
- Each test group had its own separate grid wrapper
- When showing only the most recent test, it created a grid with just one item
- This left 2/3 of the grid empty on desktop (3-column layout)

**Solution**:
- **File**: `src/app/live/page.tsx`
- Unified the grid layout to include both the most recent test AND expanded tests in the same grid
- Changed from separate grids to a single responsive grid per test group
- Combined expand/collapse button logic into one

**Changes**:
```tsx
// Before: Separate grids creating blank space
<div className="grid ...">
  <TestCard test={mostRecentTest} />
</div>
{expanded && (
  <div className="grid ...">
    {tests.slice(1).map(...)}
  </div>
)}

// After: Unified grid, no blank space
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <TestCard test={mostRecentTest} />
  {hasMultiple && isExpanded && tests.slice(1).map(test => (
    <TestCard key={test.id} test={test} />
  ))}
</div>
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Uploaded Files Not Appearing in Browse
**Problem**: After uploading files, navigating to the browse page didn't show the newly uploaded resources.

**Root Cause**: 
- The browse page only fetched resources on initial mount
- When redirecting from upload, the page was already loaded
- No mechanism to trigger a refresh after successful upload

**Solution**:
- **File 1**: `src/components/UploadWizard.tsx`
  - Added cache-busting `refresh` timestamp parameter to the redirect URL
  - Changed from `router.push('/browse')` to `router.push(\`/browse?refresh=\${Date.now()}\`)`

- **File 2**: `src/app/browse/page.tsx`
  - Added new `useEffect` to detect the `refresh` parameter
  - Triggers `fetchResources()` when refresh parameter is present
  - Forces a fresh data fetch after upload completion

**Changes**:
```typescript
// UploadWizard.tsx - Add timestamp to force refresh
setTimeout(() => {
  router.push(`/browse?refresh=${Date.now()}`)
}, 3000)

// browse/page.tsx - Listen for refresh parameter
useEffect(() => {
  const refresh = searchParams.get('refresh')
  if (refresh) {
    console.log('üîÑ Forcing browse page refresh due to new upload')
    fetchResources()
  }
}, [searchParams.get('refresh')])
```

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Auth Loop Testing
- [ ] Open the upload page while logged in
- [ ] Check browser console - should see ONE "üöÄ Initializing auth..." message
- [ ] Should NOT see repeated "üîÑ Refreshing user data..." messages
- [ ] Page should load normally without infinite loops

### 2. Past Tests Layout Testing
- [ ] Navigate to `/live` (Live Test Countdown page)
- [ ] Scroll to "SAT, ACT & PSAT" section
- [ ] Verify that test cards fill the grid properly (no excessive white space)
- [ ] Click "Show more" button to expand additional dates
- [ ] Verify all expanded dates appear in the same grid layout
- [ ] Click "Show less" to collapse - should return to single card view

### 3. Upload & Browse Testing
- [ ] Upload a new resource through `/upload`
- [ ] Wait for success message
- [ ] Should auto-redirect to `/browse` after 3 seconds
- [ ] Verify the newly uploaded resource appears at the top (sorted by newest)
- [ ] Check that URL includes `?refresh=` parameter
- [ ] Verify resource details are correct (title, type, class, etc.)

## Files Modified

1. **src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx** - Fixed infinite auth loop
2. **src/app/live/page.tsx** - Fixed blank space in past tests layout  
3. **src/components/UploadWizard.tsx** - Added refresh parameter to redirect
4. **src/app/browse/page.tsx** - Added refresh detection logic

## Impact

- **Performance**: Eliminated infinite loop that was causing unnecessary re-renders and API calls
- **UX**: Improved layout density for past tests, making better use of screen space
- **Reliability**: Uploaded resources now consistently appear in browse immediately after upload

## Notes

- All fixes are backward compatible
- No database schema changes required
- No additional dependencies added
- Console logging retained for debugging purposes
