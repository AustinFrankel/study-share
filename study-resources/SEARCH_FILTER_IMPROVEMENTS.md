# Search & Filter Improvements - October 8, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Supabase Query Error in Search Page ✅
**Problem:** Empty error object `{}` was being logged when searching resources.

**Solution:** 
- Changed the search query to use OR operator for multiple fields: `title.ilike`, `classes.title.ilike`, `classes.code.ilike`
- Added graceful error handling - instead of throwing errors, the app now returns empty results and continues
- Prevents app crashes from Supabase query errors

**File:** `src/app/search/page.tsx`

## New Features Added

### 2. Enhanced Past Tests Archive Page ✅

**Features Added:**
- **Search Bar:** Full-text search across test names, subjects, and categories
- **Advanced Filters:**
  - Category filter (College Admissions, AP Exams, NY Regents, etc.)
  - Year filter (dynamically populated from available tests)
  - Month filter (January - December)
  - Clear All button to reset all filters
- **Visual Improvements:**
  - Gradient background on filter card (indigo to purple)
  - Icons for each filter type
  - Real-time result counter showing filtered tests
  - Enhanced borders and hover states
  - Responsive grid layout for filters

**File:** `src/app/live/past/page.tsx`

### 3. Search Bar Already Exists on Live Page ✅
The live page already has a fully functional search bar that:
- Searches across test names, subjects, and categories
- Shows real-time result counts
- Has clear button (X icon)
- Positioned prominently below the hero header

**File:** `src/app/live/page.tsx` (already implemented)

## UI/UX Improvements

### Filter Bar Design
- **Layout:** 4-column responsive grid (collapses on mobile)
- **Styling:**
  - 2px indigo borders with hover effects
  - White backgrounds on select inputs
  - Gradient background on card (indigo-50 to purple-50)
  - Icons for visual hierarchy (BookOpen, Calendar, Filter)
  - Clear separation with border-bottom on header

### Search Bar Design
- **Consistent styling** across both pages:
  - Indigo color scheme
  - Search icon on left
  - Clear button (X) on right when typing
  - Large input with padding (py-4)
  - 2px borders with focus ring
  - Shadow for depth
  - Hover states for accessibility

### Result Counter
- Shows "X test types • Y total" format
- Updates in real-time as filters change
- Positioned in filter header as a badge

## Technical Implementation

### Search Functionality
```typescript
// Multi-field search
const searchMatch = !searchQuery.trim() ||
  t.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
  t.fullName.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
  (t.category && t.category.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()))
```

### Filter Combinations
All filters work together with AND logic:
- Category AND Search AND Year AND Month
- Empty state when no results match all filters

### State Management
```typescript
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState<string>('')
const [selectedCategory, setSelectedCategory] = useState<string>('all')
const [selectedYear, setSelectedYear] = useState<string>('all')
const [selectedMonth, setSelectedMonth] = useState<string>('all')
```

## Files Modified

1. **src/app/search/page.tsx**
   - Fixed Supabase query error handling
   - Changed search to use OR operator across multiple fields

2. **src/app/live/past/page.tsx**
   - Added search bar above filters
   - Added Year and Month filters
   - Enhanced filter bar styling
   - Added "Clear All" button
   - Improved responsive layout

3. **src/app/live/page.tsx**
   - No changes needed (search already implemented)

## User Experience

### Past Tests Archive Page Flow
1. User lands on page → sees all past tests
2. User types in search → results filter in real-time
3. User selects category → further narrows results
4. User selects year → shows only tests from that year
5. User selects month → shows only tests from that month
6. User clicks "Clear All" → resets all filters and search

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Search:** Most prominent (top, centered, large)
- **Filters:** Secondary (organized grid below search)
- **Results:** Clean cards with test information

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Search bar full-width on all screen sizes
- Filters stack vertically on mobile (grid-cols-1)
- 2 columns on tablets (sm:grid-cols-2)
- 4 columns on desktop (lg:grid-cols-4)
