# Supabase Setup Guide for Real Uploads

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: To make uploads work properly, you MUST complete ALL these steps in your Supabase dashboard:

## Step 1: Run the New Database Migration

**IMPORTANT**: You need to run the new migration I created to add missing columns:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard â†’ SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste this SQL and run it:

```sql
-- Add missing columns to resources table for difficulty and study time
ALTER TABLE resources ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS difficulty INTEGER DEFAULT 3 CHECK (difficulty >= 1 AND difficulty <= 5);
ALTER TABLE resources ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS study_time INTEGER DEFAULT 30; -- in minutes

-- Update files table to use consistent naming
ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS name TEXT;
ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS size BIGINT;
ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS type TEXT;
ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS path TEXT;

-- Update existing files to use new schema
UPDATE files SET 
    name = original_filename,
    type = mime,
    path = storage_path
WHERE name IS NULL;

-- Add index for difficulty for filtering
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_resources_difficulty ON resources (difficulty);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_resources_study_time ON resources (study_time);
```

## Step 2: Create Storage Bucket for File Uploads

1. Go to **Storage** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Click **Create Bucket**
3. Settings:
   - **Name**: `resources`
   - **Public bucket**: âœ… **YES** (critical for file access)
   - **File size limit**: `10MB` or higher
   - **Allowed MIME types**: Leave empty (allow all)

Or run this SQL instead:
```sql
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('resources', 'resources', true);
```

## Step 3: Set Up Storage Policies (Required for Upload Access)

In your Supabase dashboard â†’ Storage â†’ Policies, create these policies:

**For the `resources` bucket:**

1. **Upload Policy**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can upload files" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'resources');
```

2. **View Policy**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view files" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'resources');
```

3. **Delete Policy** (optional):
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own files" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (bucket_id = 'resources');
```

## Step 4: Verify Your Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env.local` file has:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

## Step 5: Test Upload Flow

1. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Try uploading a file
3. Check these locations for success:
   - **Database**: `resources` table should have new entries with `difficulty` and `study_time`
   - **Storage**: `resources` bucket should contain uploaded files
   - **Files table**: Should have records linking files to resources

## Step 6: Make Resources Publicly Visible

Run this SQL to ensure all resources show up on the browse page:

```sql
-- Make sure all resources are public and visible
UPDATE resources SET public = true WHERE public IS NULL OR public = false;

-- Verify resource visibility policy exists
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Anyone can view public resources" ON resources
FOR SELECT USING (public = true);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Upload successful" but files don't show up
**Solution**: Check if storage bucket exists and is public, verify storage policies

### Problem: Database errors during upload
**Solution**: Make sure you ran the migration in Step 1

### Problem: Teacher names rejected as "inappropriate"
**Solution**: Fixed in code - profanity filter now only blocks actual curse words

### Problem: Files upload but resources don't appear in browse page
**Solution**: Run the SQL in Step 6 to make resources public

## ðŸŽ‰ Once Complete

After completing all steps:
- âœ… File uploads will work and store permanently
- âœ… Resources will appear on the browse page for everyone
- âœ… Difficulty slider and resource type buttons will work
- âœ… Teacher names will be accepted (unless actual profanity)
- âœ… Upload progress starts immediately when files are selected
- âœ… Success message shows on screen instead of popup

## Questions?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Check your Supabase dashboard logs
3. Verify all steps above are completed exactly as written

Your upload system should now work perfectly in production! ðŸš€
