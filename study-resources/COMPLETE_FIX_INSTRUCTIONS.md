# üéØ Complete Fix Instructions

## Summary
Fixed 4 critical issues + 1 major bug:
1. ‚úÖ Navigation hover effect (scale instead of purple)
2. ‚úÖ Unique username enforcement (database + code)
3. ‚úÖ Leaderboard display fixes
4. ‚úÖ Admin past test uploads visible to everyone
5. ‚úÖ **MAJOR FIX**: Drag-and-drop file upload losing files during navigation

---

## üö® STEP 1: RUN THIS SQL (REQUIRED)

### Instructions:
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New Query**
4. Open the file: `study-resources/RUN_THIS_SQL.sql`
5. Copy the ENTIRE contents of that file
6. Paste into the SQL Editor
7. Click **RUN** (or press Ctrl+Enter / Cmd+Enter)

### What it does:
- ‚úÖ Fixes any duplicate usernames that currently exist
- ‚úÖ Adds unique constraint so no future duplicates can happen
- ‚úÖ Creates optimized leaderboard view (`user_points` materialized view)
- ‚úÖ Sets up `test_resources` table with correct permissions
- ‚úÖ Ensures admin uploads are visible to everyone (including anonymous users)

### Expected Output:
You should see green checkmarks (‚úÖ) for each step:
```
‚úÖ Step 1 Complete: Fixed duplicate handles
‚úÖ Step 2 Complete: Added unique constraint on handles
‚úÖ Step 3 Complete: Created user_points materialized view
‚úÖ Step 4 Complete: Created refresh function
‚úÖ Step 5 Complete: test_resources table ready
‚úÖ Step 6 Complete: RLS policies configured
‚úÖ Step 7 Complete: Auto-update trigger created
üéâ MIGRATION COMPLETE!
```

### If you see errors:
- Take a screenshot of the error
- Share it with me
- Don't worry - we can fix it

## üéâ STEP 2: TEST THE FILE UPLOAD FIX

### The Problem (WAS):
When you dragged a file from ANY page (homepage, profile, etc.) and dropped it, it would navigate to `/upload` but the files would be LOST.

### The Solution:
I completely rewrote the `UploadContext` to use a **global singleton storage pattern** that persists across page navigation. Files are now stored in a module-level variable that survives React component remounting.

### Files Changed:
1. **`src/contexts/UploadContext.tsx`** - Complete rewrite with global storage
2. **`src/components/GlobalDropzone.tsx`** - Removed artificial delay
3. **`src/components/UploadWizard.tsx`** - Already had logging (no changes needed)

### How to Test:
1. Go to your homepage (or any page)
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Drag a file from your computer
4. Drop it anywhere on the page
5. **Watch the console logs** - you should see:
   ```
   GlobalDropzone: Files dropped: 1
   GlobalDropzone: Valid files after filtering: 1
   GlobalDropzone: Setting pending files and navigating
   GlobalStorage: Setting 1 files
   UploadProvider: Received update from global storage: 1 files
   GlobalDropzone: Navigating to /upload
   UploadProvider: Subscribing to global storage
   UploadProvider: Syncing with global storage on mount: 1 files
   UploadWizard: pendingFiles effect: 1 files
   ```
6. **The files should appear in the upload wizard!**

### What the logs mean:
- `GlobalDropzone` = File was dropped and captured
- `GlobalStorage` = File was saved to singleton storage
- `UploadProvider` = Context received the update
- `UploadWizard` = Upload page successfully received the files

## üìã STEP 3: TEST ALL OTHER FIXES

### Test 1: Navigation Hover Effect
1. Go to your homepage
2. Hover over "Study Share" text in the navigation
3. ‚úÖ **Should**: Text scales up slightly (gets bigger)
4. ‚ùå **Should NOT**: Text turn purple

### Test 2: Unique Usernames (After Running SQL)
1. Try creating two users with the same username
2. The second one should automatically get a different handle
3. Check database: `SELECT handle, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY handle HAVING COUNT(*) > 1`
4. Should return 0 rows (no duplicates)

### Test 3: Leaderboard
1. Go to the leaderboard page
2. Should show users sorted by points
3. No errors in console
4. Run this to refresh leaderboard data:
   ```sql
   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY user_points;
   ```

### Test 4: Admin Past Test Uploads
1. Log in as admin
2. Upload a past test
3. Log out (or open incognito window)
4. Navigate to that test
5. ‚úÖ **Should**: Anonymous users can see and access the test

## üîß Technical Details

### File Upload Fix - What Changed:

**Old Approach (BROKEN):**
```typescript
// Used React state that got lost during navigation
const [pendingFiles, setPendingFiles] = useState<PendingUploadFile[]>([])
```

**New Approach (FIXED):**
```typescript
// Global singleton that survives component lifecycle
const globalFileStorage = {
  files: [] as PendingUploadFile[],
  subscribers: new Set<(files: PendingUploadFile[]) => void>(),
  
  setFiles(files: PendingUploadFile[]) {
    this.files = files
    this.subscribers.forEach(cb => cb(files))
  },
  // ... subscribe/unsubscribe logic
}
```

**Why it works:**
1. Module-level variables persist across React component remounts
2. Subscriber pattern ensures all contexts stay in sync
3. No serialization needed (File objects stay intact)
4. Survives Next.js client-side navigation
5. Automatically syncs on mount

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### File Upload Still Not Working?
1. Check console logs - where does it stop?
2. Look for these logs in order:
   - `GlobalDropzone: Files dropped`
   - `GlobalStorage: Setting X files`
   - `UploadProvider: Received update`
   - `UploadWizard: pendingFiles effect`
3. Share the console logs with me

### SQL Migration Failed?
- Share the exact error message
- Check if tables exist: `\dt` in SQL editor
- Check constraints: `\d users` to see constraints

### Leaderboard Empty?
Run this to refresh the materialized view:
```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY user_points;
```

### Users Still Have Duplicate Handles?
Run this query to see:
```sql
SELECT handle, COUNT(*), array_agg(id) as user_ids
FROM users
GROUP BY handle
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **FIRST**: Run the SQL migration
2. **SECOND**: Test file upload (most critical)
3. **THIRD**: Test other fixes
4. **FOURTH**: Set up a cron job to refresh leaderboard:
   ```sql
   REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY user_points;
   ```
   (Run this every hour or so)

## üìù Notes

### Why the global singleton approach?
- React Context state can be lost during Next.js navigation
- sessionStorage can't store File objects
- Global module variables survive component lifecycle
- Subscriber pattern keeps everything in sync
- Most reliable solution for this use case

### Performance Impact?
- Zero - files are already in memory
- No serialization overhead
- Instant state synchronization
- Works with any file size

### Will this work with multiple tabs?
- No - but that's expected behavior
- File objects can't be shared across tabs
- Each tab maintains its own upload state
- This is normal for file upload systems
