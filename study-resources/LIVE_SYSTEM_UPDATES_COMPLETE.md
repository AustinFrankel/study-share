## üîß Technical Implementation

### OCR Processing Flow
```
1. Admin uploads images
2. Images sent to OCR.space API (K84507617488957)
3. Text extracted from each image
4. Combined text parsed into structured questions:
   - Question numbers detected (1., 2., etc.)
   - Question text extracted
   - Answer choices identified (A, B, C, D)
   - Correct answers detected
   - Explanations extracted (if present)
5. Questions saved to test_resources table
6. Test becomes immediately available
```

### Question Format Detection
The OCR parser looks for:
- Question numbers: `1.`, `2.`, `Question 1`, etc.
- Answer choices: `A)`, `B:`, `C.`, `D)`, etc.
- Correct answers: `Answer: B`, `Correct: C`, etc.
- Explanations: `Explanation:`, `Rationale:`, `Because`, etc.

## üìä Database Schema

### test_resources Table
```sql
{
  id: uuid,
  test_id: string,
  test_name: string,
  questions: jsonb[], -- Array of Question objects
  uploader_id: uuid,
  created_at: timestamp
}
```

### Question Object Structure
```typescript
{
  id: string,
  questionNumber: number,
  module: number,
  passage?: string,
  questionText: string,
  choices: [
    { letter: "A", text: "..." },
    { letter: "B", text: "..." },
    { letter: "C", text: "..." },
    { letter: "D", text: "..." }
  ],
  correctAnswer: "B",
  explanation?: string
}
```
