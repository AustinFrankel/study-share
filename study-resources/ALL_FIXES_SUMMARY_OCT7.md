## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Google OAuth redirect_uri_mismatch Error

**Problem:** When clicking "Continue with Google", you saw an error message saying the redirect_uri doesn't match what's configured in Google Cloud Console.

**Root Cause:** The OAuth redirect URL was using `window.location.origin` which could be different in different environments, and wasn't matching what's configured in your Supabase project.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `/src/lib/auth.ts` to use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` as the primary redirect URL
- Falls back to `window.location.origin` if environment variable not set
- Updated `/src/app/auth/callback/route.ts` to redirect to the correct URL after auth

**What You Need To Do:**
1. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to Vercel environment variables (for production):
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
   ```

3. Follow the **OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md** file to configure Supabase correctly

4. Redeploy on Vercel after adding environment variables

### 2. Magic Link Redirecting to localhost:3000

**Problem:** When using email magic links, the link would redirect you to `localhost:3000` even when using the production site.

**Root Cause:** Same as above - redirect URLs weren't using the proper environment variable.

**Fix Applied:**
- Same fix as issue #1 - now uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` environment variable
- Magic links will now redirect to your production domain when used in production

**What You Need To Do:**
- Same steps as issue #1 above

### 3. Upload Flow Issues - Jumping Between Steps

**Problem:** 
- When uploading files, the wizard would jump to step 2/4, then glitch back to step 1/4
- Had to upload files twice
- Files weren't appearing in recent resources

**Root Cause:** The upload wizard was calling `startImmediateUpload()` when files were selected, which would show a fake "upload complete" progress bar but not actually upload to database. This confused the flow and made it seem like upload was done when it wasn't.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed premature calls to `startImmediateUpload()`
- Files are now only uploaded on final submit (step 4)
- When you select files on step 1, it now cleanly advances to step 2
- No more fake progress bars or glitching between steps
- Upload flow is now: 
  1. Select files (step 1) ‚Üí Auto-advance to step 2
  2. Add title/details (step 2) ‚Üí Click Next to step 3
  3. Select school/teacher/class (step 3) ‚Üí Click Next to step 4
  4. Review and Post ‚Üí Actually uploads to database and storage

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/components/UploadWizard.tsx`

---

### 4. .txt File Support

**Status:** ‚úÖ Already Working!

The upload wizard already accepts `.txt` files. The issue was likely related to issue #3 above (upload flow confusion). With the flow fixes, `.txt` files should now upload properly.

**Accepted file types:**
- `.pdf`
- `.doc`, `.docx`
- `.txt` ‚Üê Already supported!
- `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`
- `.heic`, `.heif`

---

### 5. Files Not Appearing in Recent Resources

**Problem:** After uploading, files weren't showing up in the recent resources section on the homepage.

**Root Cause:** This was related to issue #3 - files weren't actually being uploaded to the database because the upload process was incomplete.

**Fix Applied:**
- Fixed the upload flow (see issue #3)
- Files now properly upload to database on final submit
- Should appear immediately in recent resources (sorted by `created_at DESC`)

**Note:** If files still don't appear:
- Make sure upload completes successfully (see success message)
- Hard refresh the homepage (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
- Check browser console for any errors

- Verify Supabase redirect URLs match exactly
- Check Google Cloud Console authorized redirect URIs
- Clear browser cookies and try again

### Magic Links Not Working:
- Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is your production domain, not localhost
- Verify Supabase Site URL is set to production domain
- Redeploy after making changes

### Upload Still Glitching:
- Hard refresh the page (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache
