# Rating System, View Counter & UX Fixes - October 8, 2025

## Summary
Fixed critical rating system bugs, prevented self-rating, improved profile notifications, reorganized live page layout, added view counter functionality, improved error messages, and disabled phone authentication.

---

## 1. Fixed "Failed to Rate" Error ‚≠ê

### Problem
Users were experiencing "failed to rate" errors when rating resources due to database schema inconsistency.

### Root Cause
- **ResourceCard.tsx** used `rater_id` field
- **resource/[id]/page.tsx** used `user_id` field
- Database table `resource_ratings` expected consistent field naming

### Solution
‚úÖ Standardized both components to use `rater_id` field
‚úÖ Updated `onConflict` clauses to match: `resource_id,rater_id`

### Files Modified
- `src/components/ResourceCard.tsx` (line 115-145)
- `src/app/resource/[id]/page.tsx` (line 403-430)

---

## 2. Prevented Self-Rating üö´

### Problem
Users could rate their own uploaded resources, which shouldn't be allowed.

### Solution
‚úÖ Added uploader check before rating submission
‚úÖ Shows friendly message: "You cannot rate your own resource"

### Implementation
**ResourceCard.tsx:**
```typescript
// Prevent self-rating
if (resource.uploader_id === currentUserId) {
  showToast('You cannot rate your own resource', 'info')
  return
}
```

**resource/[id]/page.tsx:**
```typescript
// Prevent self-rating
if (resource && resource.uploader_id === user.id) {
  showNotification('You cannot rate your own resource', 'error')
  return
}
```

## 3. Improved Profile Username Change Notifications üîî

### Problem
Username change validation messages were subtle and easy to miss.

### Solution
‚úÖ Made Alert components more prominent with:
- **Bold borders** (border-2)
- **Colored backgrounds** (green for success, red for errors)
- **Larger font size** (text-base)
- **Stronger colors** (text-green-800, text-red-800)
- **Emojis** for visual clarity (‚úÖ for success, ‚ùå for errors)
- **Longer display times** (4-6 seconds instead of 2.5-3 seconds)

### Files Modified
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx` (lines 585-682, 855-865)

### Examples
- ‚úÖ Username updated successfully!
- ‚ùå Username must be at least 4 characters long
- ‚ùå Username can only contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores

---

## 4. Reorganized Live Page Layout üì±

### Problem
Admin/Waitlist link was cluttering the top button area.

### Solution
‚úÖ Removed Admin/Waitlist button from top action buttons
‚úÖ Moved to footer area below "How It Works" section
‚úÖ Styled as subtle ghost button to avoid distraction

### Files Modified
- `src/app/live/page.tsx` (lines 440-456, 742-769)

### Layout Changes
**Before:**
- Top: [View Past Tests Archive] [Admin: Waitlist]

**After:**
- Top: [View Past Tests Archive]
- Footer: Admin: Waitlist (ghost button below "How It Works")

---

## 5. Active Tests Layout ‚úì

### Status
Active tests section (SAT, ACT, PSAT) **already in a contained box** with:
- Border-2 border-green-200
- Rounded-2xl corners
- Shadow-lg
- Gradient header (green-500 to green-700)
- Content area with padding

**No changes needed** - layout matches past tests design.

---

## 6. View Counter Added üëÅÔ∏è

### Problem
No way to track how many times a resource has been viewed.

### Solution
‚úÖ Added `view_count` column to resources table
‚úÖ Created database function to increment view count
‚úÖ Display view count in ResourceCard (replacing photo count)
‚úÖ Auto-increment on resource page view
‚úÖ Styled with eye icon for visual clarity

### Implementation
**Database Migration:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION increment_view_count(resource_id UUID)
RETURNS void
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE resources
  SET view_count = COALESCE(view_count, 0) + 1
  WHERE id = resource_id;
END;
$$;
```

**ResourceCard Display:**
- Shows eye icon + view count
- Positioned where photo count was (right side metadata)
- Format: `üëÅÔ∏è 123` (short and clean)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/types.ts` (added view_count to Resource interface)
- `src/components/ResourceCard.tsx` (display view count)
- `src/app/resource/[id]/page.tsx` (increment on view)
- `supabase/migrations/050_add_increment_view_count_function.sql` (new)

---

## 7. Improved "Resource Not Found" Message ‚ùå

### Problem
Generic "Resource not found" message wasn't helpful or user-friendly.

### Solution
‚úÖ Better error message: "This resource could not be found. It may have been deleted or made private."
‚úÖ Added "Go Back Home" button for easy navigation
‚úÖ Only shows error when loading completes (not during loading state)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/resource/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 762-783)

---

## 8. Disabled Phone Authentication üì±

### Problem
Phone authentication showing "not currently configured" error when users tried to use it.

### Solution
‚úÖ Disabled phone/SMS authentication button
‚úÖ Changed label to "SMS (Soon)" to set expectations
‚úÖ Added disabled styling (opacity-50, cursor-not-allowed)
‚úÖ Added tooltip: "SMS authentication is not currently available"
‚úÖ Removed PhoneAuth component rendering (no longer accessible)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/resource/[id]/page.tsx` (sign-in modal)
- `src/components/Navigation.tsx` (main navigation auth dialog)

**UI Changes:**
- Email button: Fully functional
- SMS button: Disabled, grayed out, shows "(Soon)"
- No more confusing error messages about phone auth

---

## Testing Checklist

### Rating System
- [ ] Rate a resource (not your own) - should succeed
- [ ] Try to rate your own resource - should show "cannot rate your own resource" message
- [ ] Rate the same resource twice - should update existing rating
- [ ] Verify rating displays correctly after submission

- [ ] View count shows correct number (not undefined or 0 for viewed resources)
- [ ] Multiple views increment the counter

### Profile Notifications
- [ ] Try username < 4 characters - should show prominent red error
- [ ] Try username > 20 characters - should show prominent red error

- [ ] Successfully update username - should show prominent green success message

### Live Page Layout
- [ ] Admin/Waitlist link no longer at top
- [ ] Admin/Waitlist link visible in footer (subtle ghost button)
- [ ] Active tests section displays in contained box
- [ ] Layout matches past tests section styling

### Error Messages
- [ ] Navigate to non-existent resource - should show helpful error message
- [ ] "Go Back Home" button works correctly
- [ ] Loading states don't show error prematurely

### Phone Authentication
- [ ] SMS button is disabled and grayed out
- [ ] Shows "SMS (Soon)" label
- [ ] Hovering shows tooltip about unavailability
- [ ] No error messages when trying to use phone auth (button can't be clicked)

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- resource_ratings table structure
CREATE TABLE resource_ratings (
  resource_id UUID NOT NULL,
  rater_id UUID NOT NULL,
  rating INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (resource_id, rater_id)
);

-- resources table (view_count column)
ALTER TABLE resources
ADD COLUMN view_count integer DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;
```

### Key Functions Updated
1. **ResourceCard.tsx:** `handleRate()`, view count display
2. **resource/[id]/page.tsx:** `handleRate()`, `fetchResource()`, error handling
3. **profile/page.tsx:** `saveInlineHandle()`
4. **Navigation.tsx:** Auth dialog with disabled SMS
5. **types.ts:** Added `view_count` to Resource interface

---

## Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Error handling preserved for non-existent tables
- Optimistic UI updates still work
- Activity logging still functions correctly
- Toast/notification systems work as expected
- View counter uses secure database function (SECURITY DEFINER)
- Phone auth can be re-enabled later by removing disabled attribute
